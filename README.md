# 🚇 AI for Sustainable Cities: Urban Mobility Optimizer  
## Machine Learning Meets UN SDG 11 🌍🤖

> Project link: https://sdg-urban-mobility.streamlit.app/

This project demonstrates how **artificial intelligence can support sustainable urban development** by identifying high-demand zones in transportation systems. The insights generated can be used by city planners and transit authorities to improve route planning, reduce emissions, and promote equitable access to mobility services — directly contributing to **United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 11 (SDG 11)**.

## 🔧 Project Overview

This repository contains:

- A **Streamlit dashboard** that visualizes real-time pickup activity and clusters.
- A **Flask API backend** for serving simulated or real-world transit data.
- A **K-Means clustering engine** to dynamically identify demand hotspots.
- Tools for deploying the app locally or online.

The system allows users to:
- View live map of taxi/ride-share pickups
- Adjust number of clusters (K)
- Visualize cluster centers and statistics
- Simulate real-time updates

## 🎯 Supported SDG

### 🎯 **UN SDG 11 – Sustainable Cities and Communities**
> Make cities inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable.

By optimizing public transport, this project helps reduce:
- Traffic congestion
- Carbon emissions
- Inequitable access to transit

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Approach

- **Algorithm**: K-Means Clustering (Unsupervised Learning)
- **Input Data**: Latitude and longitude coordinates of ride pickups
- **Goal**: Identify zones with high demand to optimize bus routes and vehicle dispatching
